## About

This is a high level list of all the test types that must happen before the code is certified to go Live

## Unit Test
- Unit test must be fully mocked out and added as part of any feature addition

## Functional Test
- All the positive and negative use cases identified in the Functional test plan must pass before code sign off can happen.
- Code coverage numbers should be > 95% and must be targeted to be 100%

## End To End Customer Test
- Customer sign-off in preprod environment must be taken before prod release of new service.
- For subsequent release, backward compatibility must be ensured

## Performance Test
- Create jmeter or similar pert test tool script and run load tests
- All the APIs meet the agreed upon SLAs with respect to throughput. tp99, tp95 etc must be captured.
- In case of HA environment capacity testing must also be done to get the breaking point for a single datacenter and a single machine.
- Performance Tuning may be done at service api code level,  horizontally or vertically as teh case may be if the SLA is not met.

## Stability Test
- A stable low but continuous load must be run for an extended period of time ~ 72 hours to ensure service stability

## RAS Test
Be ruthless with the system
- Hard kill application
- Soft kill application
- Reboot host
- Remove file mount points for app and logging
- simulate memory starvation using memory hog scripts
- simulate disk full scenarios
- simulate 100% CPU usage on all cores
- Datacenter Failover testing etc.



## Log Monitoring and Log Validation
- Splunk or similar log monitoring tool must be setup with appropriate index forwarder on the app log files
- Email or appropriate notification must be setup to inform of critical alerts on a near-realtime basis eg: hourly cron for errors in past hour
- All sensitive data and PII must be masked and should never occur in plaintext in the logs
- Correct txid are being logged to trace the transactions end to end
- Log rotation should be enabled for app and system logging

## Monitoring Setup and Validation
- Alerts must be setup for Disk uitization, CPU Usage, Memory usage, at WARN and CRIT level and verified as part of RAS testing

## Code Coverage
- USe tools like  jacoco , clover or cobertura to instrument the code and get the code coverage numbers

## Continuous Integration
- Any code commit should trigger a CI job (jenkins or other) that creates runs unit test and a build artefact to be uploaded in the nexus or other source control repositories

## Continuous Deployment
- in an ideal state once the code artefact is generated by above mentioned CI job, it should automatically kick off deploy joob followed by integration test job
- for every regression phase passed the code is promoted to the next hisger level environment
eg: dev -> qa -> staging -> performance -> production

## Rollback strategy
- Despite all teh effort is there is an unintended production impact, the rollback runbook should be readily available to revert the code to previous working state. All the things to do in prd must be tested in preprod environments
